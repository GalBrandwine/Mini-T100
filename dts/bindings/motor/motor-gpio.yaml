  A generic binding for a GPIO-controlled blinking LED. Note that this binding
  has no vendor prefix, as it does not target a specific device or vendor.

  Example definition in devicetree:

    left-motor-gpio {
        compatible = "motor-gpio";
        # led-gpios = <&gpio0 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
        blink-period-ms = <1000>;
    };

compatible: "motor-gpio"

# include: base.yaml

      - "Learning"
      - "Zephyr"
